good afternoon everyone.my final year project was power generation using footsteps.


Day by day, the population of the country increased and the requirement of the power is also increased. 
At the same time the wastage of energy also increased in many ways. So reforming this energy back to usable form is the major solution.
 As technology is developed and the use of gadgets, electronic devices also increased.
 Power generation using conservative methods becoming deficient. There is a necessity arises for a different power generation method.
 At the same time the energy is wasted due to human locomotion and many ways.
 To overcome this problem, the energy wastage can be converted to usable form using the footsteps itself.
it is basically based on the principle that converting mechanical energy into an electrical energy.in this project we placed
ckt made by us below the sole of shooe whenever pressure apllied by foot the mechaniacal energy into electrical 
and the generated energy is stored in battery n whenevr we needto charge the electronics gadget that time we can use the battery.
from designing and finally to implementation my team contribute equal work in it.n my learning from this is team workn hard work.
